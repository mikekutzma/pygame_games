## life.py

*Life* is a simulation, or more specifically, a [cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_Of_Life) developed by John Conway in 1970.

In its original form, Life has three rules which determine if a cell's status changes:
1. Any live cell with fewer than 2 neighbors dies from isolation.
2. Any live cell with more than 3 neighbors dies from overcrowding.
3. Any dead cell with exactly 3 neighbors becomes a live cell.

### Controls
